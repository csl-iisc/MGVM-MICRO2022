# Akita

Akita provides a flexible, high performance, lightweight framework for developing computer architecture simulators. It is architecture agnostic so that you can define simulators for CPU, GPU, FPGA, or other accelerators. You can even use the framework to define simulators for a domain other than computer architecture.

The framework is composed of 4 main parts: the Event system, the Component System, the Connection System, and the Hook system. We will introduce them in separate sections.
