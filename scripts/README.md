Please run the scripts in the order of their prefixes.

To run individual benchmarks, first generate the scripts by running the scripts 
1\_compile\_benchmarks.py , 2\_copy\_benchmarks.sh and 3\_gen\_runners.py.

Then navigate to the newly created folder as per the required configuration, for e.g., `private`. Then navigate to `samples` sub-directory and then to the sub-directory of the benchmark in question.

A file called <benchmark\_name.sh> will be present, which will contain the exact command with appropriate options to run a particular benchmark with particular configuration..
